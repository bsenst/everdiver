This allows to preserve privacy working with your personal evernote data. As such this project is part of the [lablabai falcon hackathon](https://lablab.ai/event/falcon-llms-24-hours-hackathon/fritzlabs).

# Everdiver

Evernote does not offer the possibility to analyze your notes collection. Python can be used to access the local evernote database or exported note files and analyze the information it contains.

## Get more from your Personal Notes
- [ ] identify and visualize areas of expertise
- [ ] display the depths of knowledge in each corresponding field (beginner vs expert)
- [ ] show time course of creating/updating notes in each knowledge field
- [ ] visualize connection between notes
- [ ] identify missing knowledge comparing to outside databases
- [ ] build connectors for evernote, notion, obsidian and/or other note taking apps (import and export functions)
